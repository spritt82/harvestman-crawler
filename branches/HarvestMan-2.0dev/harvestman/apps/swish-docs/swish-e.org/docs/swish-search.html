    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="overview"></a>OVERVIEW</h1>

<p>This page describes the process of searching with Swish-e.  Please see
the <a href="swish-config.html">SWISH-CONFIG</a> page for information the Swish-e
configuration file directives, and <a href="swish-run.html">SWISH-RUN</a> for a complete
list of command line arguments.</p>
<p>Searching a Swish-e index involves passing <a href="swish-run.html">command line arguments</a> to it that specify the index file to use, and
the <a href="#searching_syntax_and_operations">query</a> (or search words) to
locate in the index.  Swish-e returns a list of file names (or URLs)
that contain the matched search words.  <a href="#searching_with_perl">Perl</a>
is often used as a front-end to Swish-e such as in CGI applications,
and <a href="#perl_modules">perl modules</a> exist to for interfacing with Swish-e.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="searching_syntax_and_operations"></a>Searching Syntax and Operations</h1>

<p>The <code>-w</code> command line argument is used specify the search query to Swish-e.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w airplane</pre>
<p>will find all documents that contain the word <b>airplane</b>.</p>
<p>When running Swish-e from a shell prompt, be careful to protect your query from
shell metacharacters and shell expansions. This often means placing single or
double quotes around your query. See <a href="#searching_with_perl">Searching with Perl</a> if you plan to use
Perl as a front end to Swish-e.  In the examples below single quotes are used
to protect the search from the shell.</p>
<p>The following section describes various aspects of searching with Swish-e.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="boolean_operators"></a>Boolean Operators</h2>

<p>You can use the Boolean operators <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, <b>near</b> or <b>not</b> in searching.
Without these Boolean operators Swish-e will assume you're <b>and</b>'ing
the words together.  The operators are not case sensitive.  These three
searches are the same:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w foo bar
    swish-e -w bar foo
    swish-e -w foo AND bar</pre>
<p>[Note: you can change the default to <b>or</b>ing by changing the variable
DEFAULT_RULE in the config.h file and recompiling Swish-e.]</p>
<p>The <b>not</b> operator inverts the results of a search.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">   swish-e -w not foo</pre>
<p>finds all the documents that do not contain the word foo.</p>
<p>Parentheses can be used to group searches.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">   swish-e -w 'not (foo and bar)'</pre>
<p>The result is all documents that have none or one term, but not both.</p>
<p>To search for the words <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, <b>near</b> or <b>not</b>, place them in a double quotes.
Remember to protect the quotes from the shell:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w '"not"'
    swish-e -w \"not\"</pre>
<p>will search for the word "not".</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">     swish-e -w smilla or snow</pre>
<p>Retrieves files containing either the words "smilla" or "snow".</p>
<pre class="pre-section">     swish-e -w smilla snow not sense 
     swish-e -w '(smilla and snow) and not sense'  (same thing)</pre>
<p>retrieves first the files that contain both the words "smilla" and
"snow"; then among those the ones that do not contain the word "sense".</p>
<p>The <b>near</b> keyword is similar to <b>and</b> but implies a proximity between the
words. The <b>near</b> keyword takes a integer argument as well, indicating
the maximum distance between two words to consider a valid match.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section"> swish-e -w smilla near5 snow</pre>
<p>would match the document if the words <code>smilla</code> and <code>snow</code> appeared within 5
positions of one another.</p>
<p>A <b>near</b> search with no argument or argument of 0 is the same as an <b>and</b> search.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="wildcards"></a>Wildcards</h2>

<p>Two different wildcard characters are available, each evoking different behaviour.</p>
<p>The <code>*</code> means "match zero or more characters."</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> means "match exactly one character."</p>
<p>The wildcard <code>*</code> may only be used at the end
of a word. Otherwise <code>*</code> is considered a normal character (i.e. can be
searched for if included in the WordCharacters directive).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w librarian</pre>
<p>this query only retrieves files which contain the given word.</p>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w 'librarian*'</pre>
<p>retrieves "librarians", "librarianship", etc. along with "librarian".</p>
<p>Note that wildcard searches combined with word stemming can lead
to unexpected results.  If stemming is enabled, a search term with a
wildcard will be stemmed internally before searching.  So searching for
<code>running*</code> will actually be a search for <code>run*</code>, so <code>running*</code> would
find <code>runway</code>.  Also, searching for <code>runn*</code> will not find <code>running</code>
as you might expect, since <code>running</code> stems to <code>run</code> in the index,
and thus <code>runn*</code> will not find <code>run</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> wildcard matches exactly one character, but may not be used
at the start of a word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w 's?ow'</pre>
<p>will match <code>snow</code>, <code>slow</code> and <code>show</code> but <b>not</b> <code>strow</code>.</p>
<p>This:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w '?how'</pre>
<p>will throw an error.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="order_of_evaluation"></a>Order of Evaluation</h2>

<p>In general, the order of evaluation is not important.  Internally swish-e
processes the search terms from left to right.  Parenthesis can be used
to group searches together, effectively changing the order of evaluation.
For example these three are the same:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w foo not bar baz
    swish-e -w not bar foo baz
    swish-e -w baz foo not bar</pre>
<p>but these two are <b>not</b> the same:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w foo not bar baz
    swish-e -w foo not (bar baz)</pre>
<p>The first finds all documents that contain both foo and baz, but do not
contain bar.  The second finds all that contain foo, and contain either bar or
baz, but not both.</p>
<p>It is often helpful in understanding searches to use the boolean terms and
parenthesis. So the above two become:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w foo AND (not bar) AND baz
    swish-e -w foo AND (not (bar AND baz))</pre>
<p>These four examples are all the same search (assuming that AND is the default
search type):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w 'juliet not ophelia and pac'
    swish-e -w '(juliet) AND (NOT ophelia) AND (pac)'
    swish-e -w 'juliet not ophelia pac'
    swish-e -w 'pac and juliet and not ophelia'</pre>
<p>Looking at the the first three searches, first Swish-e finds all the documents
with "juliet".  Then it finds all documents that do not contain "ophelia".
Those two lists are then combined with the boolean AND operator resulting with
a list of documents that include "juliet" but not "ophelia".  Finally, that
list is ANDed with the list of documents that contain "pac" resulting.</p>
<p>However it is always possible to force the order of evaluation by using
parenthesis.  For example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w 'juliet not (ophelia and pac)'</pre>
<p>retrieves files with "juliet" that do not contain both words "ophelia" and
"pac".</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="meta_tags"></a>Meta Tags</h2>

<p>MetaNames are used to represent <i>fields</i> (called <i>columns</i> in a
database) and provide a way to search in only parts of a document.
See <a href="swish-config.html#document_contents_directives">SWISH-CONFIG</a> for
a description of MetaNames, and how they are specified in the source
document.</p>
<p>To limit a search to words found in a meta tag you prefix the keywords
with the name of the meta tag, followed by the equal sign:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    metaname = word
    metaname = (this or that)
    metaname = ( (this or that) or "this phrase" )</pre>
<p>It is not necessary to have spaces at either side of the "=", consequently
the following are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w "metaName=word"
    swish-e -w "metaName = word"
    swish-e -w "metaName= word"</pre>
<p>To search on a word that contains a "=", precede the "=" with a "\"
(backslash).</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w "test\=3 = x\=4 or y\=5"</pre>
<p>this query returns the files where the word "x=4" is associated with
the metaName "test=3" or that contains the word "y=5" not associated
with any metaName.</p>
<p>Queries can be also constructed using any of the usual search features,
moreover metaName and plain search can be mixed in a single query.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">     swish-e -w "metaName1 = (a1 or a4) not (a3 and a7)"</pre>
<p>This query will retrieve all the files in which "a1" or "a2" are found
in the META tag "metaName1" and that do not contain the words "a3" and
"a7", where "a3" and "a7" are not associated to any meta name.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="phrase_searching"></a>Phrase Searching</h2>

<p>To search for a phrase in a document use double-quotes to delimit your
search terms.  (The phrase delimiter is set in src/swish.h.)</p>
<p>You must protect the quotes from the shell.</p>
<p>For example, under Unix:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w '"this is a phrase" or (this and that)'
    swish-e -w 'meta1=("this is a phrase") or (this and that)'</pre>
<p>Or under Windows:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w \"this is a phrase\" or (this and that)</pre>
<p>You can not use boolean search terms inside a phrase.  That is:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w 'this and that'</pre>
<p>finds documents with both words "this" and "that", but:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -w '"this and that"'</pre>
<p>finds documents that have the phrase "that and that".  A phrase can consist of
a single word, so this is how to search for the words used as boolean
operators:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">   swish-e -w 'this "and" that'</pre>
<p>finds documents that contain all three words, but in any order.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>-P</code> switch to set the phrase delimiter character.
See <a href="swish-run.html">SWISH-RUN</a> for examples.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="context"></a>Context</h2>

<p>At times you might not want to search for a word in every part of
your files since you know that the word(s) are present in a particular
tag. The ability to search according to context greatly increases the
chances that your hits will be relevant, and Swish-e provides a mechanism
to do just that.</p>
<p>The -t option in the search command line allows you to search for words
that exist only in specific HTML tags. Each character in the string
you specify in the argument to this option represents a different tag
in which the word is searched; that is you can use any combinations of
the following characters:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    H means all&lt;HEAD&gt; tags
    B stands for &lt;BODY&gt; tags
    t is all &lt;TITLE&gt; tags
    h is &lt;H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt; (header) tags
    e is emphasized tags (this may be &lt;B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;, or &lt;STRONG&gt;)
    c is HTML comment tags (&lt;!-- ... --&gt;)

    # This search will look for files with these two words in their titles only.
    swish-e -w "apples oranges" -t t

    # This search will look for files with these words in comments only.
    swish-e -w "keywords draft release" -t c

    This search will look for words in titles, headers, and emphasized tags.
    swish-e -w "world wide web" -t the</pre>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="searching_with_perl"></a>Searching with Perl</h1>

<p>Perl ( <a href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</a> ) is probably the most common programming
language used with Swish-e, especially in CGI interfaces.  Perl makes
searching and parsing results with Swish-e easy, but if not done properly
can leave your server vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>When designing your CGI scripts you should carefully screen user input,
and include features such as paged results and a timer to limit time
required for a search to complete.  These are to protect your web site
against a denial of service (DoS) attack.</p>
<p>Included with every distribution of Perl is a document called perlsec --
Perl Security.  <i>Please</i> take time to read and understand that document
before writing CGI scripts in perl.</p>
<p>Type at your shell/command prompt:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    perldoc perlsec</pre>
<p>If nothing else, start every CGI program in perl as such:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    #!/usr/local/bin/perl -wT
    use strict;</pre>
<p>That alone won't make your script secure, but may help you find insecure
code.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="cgi_danger_"></a>CGI Danger!</h2>

<p>There are many examples of CGI scripts on the Internet.  Many are poorly
written and insecure.  A commonly seen way to execute Swish-e from a
perl CGI script is with a <i>piped open</i>.  For example, it is common to
see this type of <code>open()</code>:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    open(SWISH, "$swish -w $query -f $index|");</pre>
<p>This <code>open()</code> gives shell access to the entire Internet!  Often an
attempt is made to strip <code>$query</code> of <i>bad</i> characters.  But, this
often fails since it's hard to guess what every <i>bad</i> character is.
Would you have thought about a null?  A better approach is to only allow
<i>in</i> known safe characters.</p>
<p>Even if you can be sure that any user supplied data is safe, this
<i>piped open</i> still passes the command parameters through the shell.
If nothing else, it's just an extra unnecessary step to running Swish-e.</p>
<p>Therefore, the recommended approach is to fork and exec <code>swish-e</code> directly
without passing through the shell.  This process is described in the
perl man page <code>perlipc</code> under the appropriate heading <b>Safe Pipe Opens</b>.</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    perldoc perlipc</pre>
<p>If all this sounds complicated you may wish to use a Perl module that
does all the hard work for you.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="perl_modules"></a>Perl Modules</h2>

<p>The Swish-e distribution includes a Perl module called SWISH::API.
SWISH::API provides access to the Swish-e C Library.</p>
<p>The SWISH::API module is <i>not</i> installed by default.</p>
<p>The SWISH::API module will <i>embed</i> Swish-e into your perl program so that searching does
not require running an external program.  Embedding the Swish-e program into your perl
program results in faster Swish-e searches, especially when running under a
persistent environment like mod_perl since it avoids the cost of opening the
index file for every request (mod_perl is much also much faster than CGI because it
avoids the need to compile Perl code for every request).</p>
<p>See the README file in the <i>perl</i> directory of the Swish-e distribution for installation
instructions.  Documentation for the SWISH::API module is available at
<a href="http://swish-e.org">http://swish-e.org</a> and is installed along with other HTML documentation on your computer.</p>
